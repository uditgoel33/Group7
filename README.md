# Group7
Capstone project for Masters of Data Science students related to asset identification and tagging.

## Outline:
the purpose of this project is to develop a model that accurately identifies one or more asset types from an as-built drawing file and then generate a tabularized dataset on their locations.

## Contents:

A - asset_finder: code for the identification of desired assets.

B - room_finder: code for the identification of rooms and their boundaries.

C - asset_linking: code for the merging of results and serialization of output data.

D - symbols: storage of asset data used in identification

E - floorplans: as-built drawings used in development and testing

F - outputs: testing outputs
